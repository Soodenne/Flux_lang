# Flux - Flexible Programming Language for Web Development

## Introduction
Flux is a flexible programming language for web development. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and to be a good fit for a wide range of web development tasks. Flux is a general-purpose language, but it is particularly well-suited for web development because it has built-in support for common web development tasks such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flux is also designed to be easy to integrate with other web technologies, such as databases and web services.
## Features
Flux has a number of features that make it well-suited for web development. Some of the key features of Flux include:
- Built-in support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Easy integration with other web technologies
- A flexible and expressive syntax
- A powerful standard library
- A rich set of built-in data types and data structures
- A comprehensive set of built-in functions and operators
- A powerful module system
- FluxVM - a fast and efficient virtual machine for running Flux programs

## Getting Started
To get started with Flux, you will need to install the Flux compiler and runtime. You can download the latest version of the Flux compiler and runtime from the. Once you have installed the Flux compiler and runtime, you can start writing and running Flux programs.

## Installation
Building Flux from source is easy. Just follow these steps:
1. Clone the Flux repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Runway-Club/flux_lang.git
```
2. Change to the Flux directory:
```bash
cd flux_lang
```
3. Build the Flux compiler and runtime:
```bash
make build
```
Flux binaries will be built in the `bin` directory.

In order to install the Flux VM on Unix systems, you can run the following command:
```bash
chmod +x bin/flux
cp bin/flux /usr/local/bin
```

## Running Flux Programs
Once you have installed the Flux compiler and runtime, you can start writing and running Flux programs. Here is an example of a simple Flux program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
```flux
out('Hello, world')
```

To run this program, save it to a file called `hello.flux` and then run the following command:
```bash
flux run -i hello.flux
```
